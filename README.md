# PrefessionalPortfolio

This is my Professional Portfolio that I constructed using HTML5 and CSS.


My Professional Portfolio begins with my name as a Header


My headshot picture is rather recent, and I chose to place it on the lefthand side of the page in a box that should shrink if you are using a mobile platform to access it. 

My about me section is still being worked on, I am looking forward to adding more skills and abilities once I have learned them.

I don't have many projects listed on my page, and my resume is still being worked on, however my Github link should work where you can access my current repositories. The link to my resume will take you to a PDF file that can be clearly seen and printed out if needed. 

I was able to use some tricks and responsive techniques from previous mini projects in order to make some elements on my page pop, and I plan on including some javascript projects in the near future.
